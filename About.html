        <h3>About our establishment</h3>
        <p>Heartstone state park was founded on the noble principles of our forefathers. 
            With the preservation of our mighty mountains and forrests being the top priority.
            We strive to create an enviroment that is safe and engaging for anyone who wishes to commune with nature.
            Our founder, Patterson Greer, believed that nature belonged to the people and it was our duty to protect it and care for it.
            He was a great man who fought tooth and nail to get the land of this beloved park establisehd as a natural reservation, 
            and to get it sanctioned as a state park. This though a big win was not the end of the bumps in the road.
            In 1923 the park was decimated by a tornado. This was a major problem. The repair costs of the park were far greater than the budget alowed. 
            The park almost went under; However, in 1924 a sizable donation was made from an anonomous source that was large enough to save the park from financial downfall.
            This allowed a complete turn around and allowed for the park to recieve the repairs it needed and officialy reopen in 1925. 
            Ever since this park has strived to be a pillar of our commuity and has become an icon of our great State.
