        <h3>This Weeks Events</h3>
        <p>For this week's special event don't forget your rod and reel for the $1000 annual fishing tournament! A yearly tradition here at Heartstone Park.
            Come join us this coming weekend for a chance at a $1000 grand prize! The rules are simple. The boat with the greatest fish-to-weight ratio by the end of 
            the five hours gets the grand prize! But do not fret if you are not on the winning team, because you still have a chance at a whopping $500 which will be awarded to the team with the
            biggest catch of the day! So what are you waiting for? Visit our contact page and give us a call so we can fill you in on registration costs and tournament rules to make it a fun day for everyone. </p></main>
